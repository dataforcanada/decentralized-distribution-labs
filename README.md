## 🏗️ Open Processing Architecture

We believe that true open data requires open production. To ensure the longevity and resilience of Canada's data infrastructure, we treat our data pipelines as **open source software artifacts**. We provide the "blueprints" alongside the data, allowing any user to verify our work or rebuild the dataset from scratch on their own infrastructure.

### The Blueprint Model

Our processing strategy relies on three immutable components to guarantee transparency:

1. **Build Manifests:** Every dataset version is accompanied by a strict manifest. This locks the exact "ingredients" used: the cryptographic hashes of the raw source files, the specific Git commit of the processing code, and the configuration parameters.
2. **Environment Definitions:** Rather than opaque binaries, we publish the exact **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** definitions (e.g., Dockerfiles). This allows users to inspect the system context (GDAL versions, libraries, and dependencies) and build the environment themselves.
3. **Deterministic Builds:** By combining a *Build Manifest* with our *Environment Definitions*, any user can execute a **deterministic build**. This process guarantees a bit-for-bit identical copy of the official Data for Canada artifact, ensuring that the pipeline is independent of our specific servers.

**Mirrored Source Artifacts:**
Crucially, we do not rely solely on external version control systems like GitHub, which may change or disappear. A complete snapshot of the processing code, environment definitions, and manifests is bundled with every data release. These source artifacts are replicated across **Source Cooperative, Zenodo, the Internet Archive, Data for Canada infrastructure, and the community**, ensuring that the *method* of creation is preserved with the same redundancy as the *result*.

## Dissemination Process

Once data products reach a production-ready state, they enter a dissemination flow designed for permanence and performance:

* **Cloud-Native First:** Priority is given to performant, system-to-system file formats (e.g., Parquet) to enable high-throughput applications without the need for local parsing.
* **Persistent Identification:** Every dataset version is assigned a DOI for citation and immutability.
* **The FAIR Data Catalog:** Global metadata is aggregated into a single, queryable **[FAIR Data Catalog](https://stac-utils.github.io/stac-geoparquet/latest/spec/stac-geoparquet-spec/)**. This catalog acts as the "brain" of the system, tracking all versions and DOIs, and directing users to the optimal source within our multi-tier storage network:
    - **[Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/dataforcanada)** serves as our **primary mirror** for all datasets, including large-scale products like orthoimagery.
    - **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/dataforcanada/)** serves as our repository for **long-term academic preservation** and provides a high-speed mirror for European users.
    - **[The Internet Archive](https://archive.org)** is utilized **strategically** for specific datasets to ensure historical redundancy.
    - **[Data for Canada Infrastructure](https://www.dataforcanada.org/infrastructure/)** is utilized **strategically** for specific datasets of high-value.

### Decentralized Distribution

We are piloting a <abbr title="Peer-to-Peer">P2P</abbr> technology, to maximize infrastructure resilience. By leveraging the [P2P HTTP  consumption feature](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html), users will be able to download simultaneously from Source Cooperative, Zenodo, Data for Canada infrastructure, and community peers. This ensures high availability without a single point of failure. Current laboratory work is available in the [Decentralized Distribution Labs](https://github.com/dataforcanada/decentralized-distribution-labs).

## Work in the Lab: Smart Nodes

To further democratize access and ensure the persistence of Canada’s open data, we are experimenting with the features defined in previous work done by other organizations.

A Smart Node functions as a "set-it-and-forget-it" volunteer server, an automated library branch for our data infrastructure.

* **Automated Mirroring:** Unlike a standard download, a Smart Node automatically synchronizes with our central **FAIR Data Catalog**. It intelligently fetches new or "at-risk" datasets to ensure they remain available even if the central portal experiences downtime.
* **Volunteer-Powered Resilience:** This model allows partner institutions (ex. universities, research labs) and public volunteers to donate bandwidth and storage. By running a Smart Node, contributors actively protect vital Canadian datasets from being lost or gated.

* **Dynamic Storage Management:** The node software monitors network health to optimize resource usage. Leveraging the  <abbr title="Peer-to-Peer">P2P</abbr> technology's capability for **selective piece mapping**, the node does not need to store the entire catalog. Instead, it identifies specific file indices or "rare" pieces within the metadata and sends granular `REQUEST` messages for only those blocks. This allows a node with limited storage (ex. 500GB) to provide critical redundancy for a much larger archive (ex. 50TB) by surgically targeting only the data that is currently under shared.

We are currently refining the concepts from [smart-node-transmission](https://github.com/academictorrents/smartnode-transmission) to work seamlessly with our catalog, enabling a fully decentralized data mesh for Canadian geospatial information.

## Roadmap: Resilience & Transparency

To support our mission of providing high-performance, analysis-ready data, we are currently developing a suite of public tools to make this distributed ecosystem more **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), **resilient**, and **transparent**.

These planned features are designed to help researchers and automated systems coordinate data access across the various platforms and mirrors we utilize.

### 1. Real-Time Service Status

We are building a comprehensive status dashboard that monitors the availability of the diverse storage locations we rely on, from our own Smart Nodes to external providers like the Internet Archive, Source Cooperative, and Zenodo. Users will be able to verify if a specific mirror is operational before initiating workflows.

### 2. Traffic & Load Optimization Statistics

To foster better cooperation between our systems and downstream users, we plan to expose traffic and connectivity statistics where possible.

This transparency allows automated systems to be "smart" about data retrieval. For example, a system could query these statistics to schedule bandwidth-intensive HTTP downloads during non-peak hours, or adjust behavior based on current connectivity loads during high-traffic periods of the workday. This improves performance for individual users while respecting the bandwidth constraints of the various host providers.

### 3. Community Issue Reporting

We are introducing a streamlined method for users to report access issues across any of the services we aggregate. By allowing the community to flag connectivity drops or data integrity issues quickly, we can identify bottlenecks or outages at specific providers and route users to alternative sources more effectively.
